1: Bug: When the app is opened - user needs to manually resize the app screen to fix the JME view being off the panel (MacOS only).
2: Bug: JME view lighting in the scene becomes dark after screen resize (MacOS only).
3: Idea: New snapping type - object to object snapping.
4: Idea: New setting for grid layout - Centered Grid (current default grid that starts at the origin (0, 0, 0) of the world and goes in both negative and positive directions) or Corner-based Grid (origin at corner of world 0 0 0 and goes only in positive direction)
5: Idea: Add more simulations
6: Idea: Add more KPIs
7: Idea: Import/Export different CAD formats, for example .dwg
8: Bug: After new model import sometimes a full restart of the app is needed for the model to become available for loading into the scene. (Check caches)
